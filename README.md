# Budget-App

Budget App is a web application implemented with Javascript. This project allowed me to practice more advanced JS features like adding items dynamically to the web page. 

I also had the opportunity to use C.R.U.D (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. A user can create an expense, read existing expenses, update an existing expense, and delete expenses. The page dynamically responds to these changes. 

The styling is very clean and minimalistic, with an emphasis on an enhanced user experience.
